	abstract = {A hidden Markov model of signal peptides has been developed. It contains submodels for the N-terminal part, the hydrophobic region, and the region around the cleavage site. For known signal peptides, the model can be used to assign objective boundaries between these three regions. Applied to our data, the length distributions for the three regions are significantly different from expectations. For instance, the assigned hydrophobic region is between 8 and 12 residues long in almost all eukaryotic signal peptides. This analysis also makes obvious the difference between eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The model can be used to predict the location of the cleavage site, which it finds correctly in nearly 70\% of signal peptides in a cross-validated test--almost the same accuracy as the best previous method. One of the problems for existing prediction methods is the poor discrimination between signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors, but this is substantially improved by the hidden Markov model when expanding it with a very simple signal anchor model.},

	issn = {1471-2105},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-6-167},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proteins carrying twin-arginine (Tat) signal peptides are exported into the periplasmic compartment or extracellular environment independently of the classical Sec-dependent translocation pathway. To complement other methods for classical signal peptide prediction we here present a publicly available method, TatP, for prediction of bacterial Tat signal peptides.
RESULTS: We have retrieved sequence data for Tat substrates in order to train a computational method for discrimination of Sec and Tat signal peptides. The TatP method is able to positively classify 91\% of 35 known Tat signal peptides and 84\% of the annotated cleavage sites of these Tat signal peptides were correctly predicted. This method generates far less false positive predictions on various datasets than using simple pattern matching. Moreover, on the same datasets TatP generates less false positive predictions than a complementary rule based prediction method.
CONCLUSION: The method developed here is able to discriminate Tat signal peptides from cytoplasmic proteins carrying a similar motif, as well as from Sec signal peptides, with high accuracy. The method allows filtering of input sequences based on Perl syntax regular expressions, whereas hydrophobicity discrimination of Tat- and Sec-signal peptides is carried out by an artificial neural network. A potential cleavage site of the predicted Tat signal peptide is also reported. The TatP prediction server is available as a public web server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TatP/.},

	abstract = {When predicting the subcellular localization of proteins from their amino acid sequences, there are basically three approaches: signal-based, global property-based, and homology-based. Each of these has its advantages and drawbacks, and it is important when comparing methods to know which approach was used. Various statistical and machine learning algorithms are used with all three approaches, and various measures and standards are employed when reporting the performances of the developed methods. This chapter presents a number of available methods for prediction of sorting signals and subcellular localization, but rather than providing a checklist of which predictors to use, it aims to function as a guide for critical assessment of prediction methods.},

	abstract = {According to the signal hypothesis, a signal sequence, once having initiated export of a growing protein chain across the rough endoplasmic reticulum, is cleaved from the mature protein at a specific site. It has long been known that some part of the cleavage specificity resides in the last residue of the signal sequence, which invariably is one with a small, uncharged side-chain, but no further specific patterns of amino acids near the point of cleavage have been discovered so far. In this paper, some such patterns, based on a sample of 78 eukaryotic signal sequences, are presented and discussed, and a first attempt at formulating rules for the prediction of cleavage sites is made.},

	doi = {10.1093/gbe/evv088},
	abstract = {The amino acid composition (AAC) of proteomes differs greatly between microorganisms and is associated with the environmental niche they inhabit, suggesting that these changes may be adaptive. Similarly, the oligonucleotide composition of genomes varies and may confer advantages at the DNA/RNA level. These influences overlap in protein-coding sequences, making it difficult to gauge their relative contributions. We disentangle these effects by systematically evaluating the correspondence between intergenic nucleotide composition, where protein-level selection is absent, the AAC, and ecological parameters of 909 prokaryotes. We find that G + C content, the most frequently used measure of genomic composition, cannot capture diversity in AAC and across ecological contexts. However, di-/trinucleotide composition in intergenic DNA predicts amino acid frequencies of proteomes to the point where very little cross-species variability remains unexplained (91\% of variance accounted for). Qualitatively similar results were obtained for 49 fungal genomes, where 80\% of the variability in AAC could be explained by the composition of introns and intergenic regions. Upon factoring out oligonucleotide composition and phylogenetic inertia, the residual AAC is poorly predictive of the microbes' ecological preferences, in stark contrast with the original AAC. Moreover, highly expressed genes do not exhibit more prominent environment-related AAC signatures than lowly expressed genes, despite contributing more to the effective proteome. Thus, evolutionary shifts in overall AAC appear to occur almost exclusively through factors shaping the global oligonucleotide content of the genome. We discuss these results in light of contravening evidence from biophysical data and further reading frame-specific analyses that suggest that adaptation takes place at the protein level.},
